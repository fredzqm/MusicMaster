  I2C Generated Driver File

  @Company
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name
    i2c.c

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the I2C driver using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for I2C.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC16F1937
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v2.35 or v3.00
